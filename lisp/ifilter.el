;;; ifilter.el --- Filter a list in its buffer incrementally -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Author: vhqr0 <zq_cmd@163.com>
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "31.1"))
;; Version: 0.1.0
;; Keywords: matching, convenience

;;; Commentary:

;; A buffer listing candidates under a filter field.  Unlike a
;; selection, nothing waits for a result: the buffer persists, and its
;; filter can be changed at any time.
;;
;; The first line of the buffer is the filter field and an Update
;; button, as the search field of Customize, and each line after it
;; shows a candidate.  The candidates not matching the filter are hidden
;; by overlays, so filtering never changes the text, and `undo' only
;; undoes the edits of the filter.  The candidates shown are changed
;; only by `revert-buffer', even if the commands on them change their
;; source.
;;
;; A candidate is (STRING . DATA).  STRING is shown and matched, with
;; its newlines shown as ^J, and the candidates of empty STRING are
;; skipped.  The filter is a regexp, but spaces match any string, as
;; ".*".  It is converted by `ifilter-regexp-function', and matches
;; ignoring case unless it has an upper case letter, as isearch and
;; occur.
;;
;; In the buffer:
;;
;; - `RET' in the filter field or on the button, and `C-c C-u', update
;;   the filter.
;; - `C-c C-/', and `/' outside the filter field, read the filter in
;;   the minibuffer, and apply it.
;; - `C-c C-s' suspends updating the filter automatically.
;; - `g' collects the candidates again, keeping the filter.
;; - `M-RET' previews the candidate at point in another window, keeping
;;   the selected one.  `M-n' and `M-p', also in the filter field, move
;;   to the next and previous candidates shown, and preview them.
;;
;; A tool is a child mode of `ifilter-mode' and a command opening its
;; buffer.  The mode binds the commands on the candidates, which get the
;; candidate at point by `ifilter-candidate', and sets
;; `revert-buffer-function' to collect the candidates again and call
;; `ifilter-render', and may set `ifilter-preview-function'.
;;
;; The tools:
;;
;; - `ifilter-imenu' shows the index of the current buffer.  `RET'
;;   jumps to an item in another window, previewed by displaying it.
;; - `ifilter-outline' shows the outline headings of the current buffer,
;;   each as the path of the lines of it and its ancestors.  `RET' and
;;   the preview are as in `ifilter-imenu'.
;; - `ifilter-kill-ring' shows the kill ring.  `RET' selects a kill
;;   shown whole in another buffer, also previewed so.  `w' or `C-c C-w'
;;   moves it to the front of the kill ring, and `k' or `C-c C-k'
;;   deletes it.  The kill ring is shown again by `g', or with prefix
;;   arg, rather than at once, to keep the position.
;;
;; `ifilter-imenu' and `ifilter-outline' each show in one buffer.
;; Called from another buffer, they show its items instead, clearing
;; the filter.
;;
;; The filter is updated automatically `ifilter-delay' seconds after the
;; last command, 0.2 by default.  To wait longer, or never:
;;
;;   (setq ifilter-delay 0.5)
;;   (setq ifilter-delay -1)
